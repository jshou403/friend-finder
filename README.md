## How The App Works
This full stack application takes user input from the front end and posts it to the back end using the [node.js] [express] router and body parser middlewares. Once the input is submitted, it is routed to and posted to the back end. Here, the user's response is added to our API and also compared to the API's existing information to determine the user's friend match. Once determined, the post route stores the result of the friend match and the front end is able to receive this data which is then displayed to the user.
